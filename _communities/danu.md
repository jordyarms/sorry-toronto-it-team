name: Danu Social House
description: "When we started Danu in July 2022, we imagined a place where you could spark a conversation with a stranger, stumble across new art and ideas, and lend support to the organizations fighting for a better Toronto; a bar in a living room. Several times a week we host free events that bring people together: book clubs, food pop-ups, fundraisers, game nights, art shows, our famous house parties, and more. We also offer free space for grassroots organizations like Encampment Support Network Parkdale, Climate Justice Toronto and The People's Voice to hold meetings and fundraisers."
