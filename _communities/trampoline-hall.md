name: Trampoline Hall
description: "Trampoline Hall is a barroom lecture series that has been running monthly in Toronto since before forever, and has sold out every show since its inception. The talks range from serious to ridiculous, with the one rule being that speakers cannot be professionally expert on their topic (though they are often very knowledgeable)."
