name: Maggie's Toronto Sex Workers Action Project
description: "Maggie's Toronto Sex Workers Action Project is Canada's oldest sex worker justice initiative offering wrap-around services, and life-affirming care to current and form sex workers across Toronto and the GTA. From street outreach and harm reduction services/supports to case management, drop-in programming and community-specific resources for parents, QTBIPOC sex workers and male-identified workers, at the core of our work is an earnest belief that sex workers themselves are best equipped to determine what safety, dignity and community connection means to us."
