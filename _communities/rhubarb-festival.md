description: "Rhubarb is Buddies at its rawest: a hotbed of unruly creatives queering what it means to make and experience art. Canada's longest-running genre-bending live arts festival has brought you wrestling, space opera, chainsaw-wielding teddy bears, bathroom Shakespeare, clown sisters, and cake."
