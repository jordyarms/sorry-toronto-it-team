name: Team UltraBlack / Ultra Black Wellness Society
description: Empowering our Black peers through fitness, wellness and community. We believe that resilience, discipline and community are the necessary ingredients to any form of success. But we also understand that it can be difficult to take the first steps. By creating engaging events, challenges and experiences, we hope to serve as a safe and accountable wellness space for the Black community. We aspire to be the catalyst for the changes we hope to see in and for our people. At the same time, we know it is equally important to collaborate with other organizations and contribute to the larger fitness community. Introducing our members to various organizations and experiences will increase the level of diversity in fitness and wellness spaces in Toronto and Canada.
