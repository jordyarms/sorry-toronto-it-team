name: Eglinton Vaughan Community Land Trust
description: "The Eglinton Vaughan Community Land Trust (EVCLT) is a grassroots movement born out of the resilience and determination of the residents of OVCO and Keele-Eglinton. United by a shared vision of a diverse and engaged community, we are reclaiming control over our neighbourhood's future through the establishment of a Community Land Trust (CLT). At our core, we believe that housing is a fundamental human right, and we are taking bold action to ensure safe, affordable, and dignified housing for all."
